- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @garenaobama aka phuongzoro
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in making website. I studied about it since I was in high school. Since then, I've made some interesting webpage. But I only have a real product when I went to University. 
- ðŸ‘€ I can work with some basic web languages (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT), database platform like SQLSERVER, java (servlet web, my biggest and best project was a servlet web 'PRJ301PROJECT')
- I'm keep learning new things.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in video games. When I was a kid, I want to make a successful videogame. I have a long time learn to design and work with Unity. Even when I went to university, I still learn about it and have a plan and a piece of work on a casual game. As university requires time so I have to stop the project. But I know how to design, and it help me to create good looking websites.
- I should focus on one thing (web) only, shouldn't I ? But i'll try other things when I have opportunity !
